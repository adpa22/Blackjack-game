For the hint system, i first did the difference betweeen 21 and the dealer's hand in the player class. Then, in my player class I made three different methods depending on what the player wanted (probability to get exactly 21, below 21, or bust). I went through the deck, and whatever card fitted the description, I added 1 to my counter. Also, every time I dealt a card, the total card counter counter would go down. I then outputted a fraction of the cards that I needed that fitted my descripiton and the denometer was the amount of cards in the deck. Accounting for aces was diffucult with this, but I basically did an ace count depending on the player's hand and what he/she needed by subtracting 10 from aces accordingly. 

Another diffuculuty I had was with splitting, but I found out that making 2 new arraylists in the player class made the job a lot more eaiser. After that, I treated each hand seprately. Making methods for this was annoying because i basiclaly had to make the same methods twice. But it was easier considered i didn't have to do much thinking for the methods because I already had it outlined with my original player methods.

I really deviated from my hint system in MS2 text file because I realized that that wasn't card counting, it was just basic strategy. I also deviated in my deck class by making the deck 312 cards (6 decks) instead of just 52 card (1 deck). 

I learned that i should really organize my code more because as I was moving along and implenting more code, it was getting really hard to find code that i wanted to fix in the jungle of things. I should probably get more efficient to because some of my ways to approach things are not effieicent because I have alot of repitive things i put in code. At the end, my game worked the way I wanted it to, so I'm still happy with the way it turned out.
